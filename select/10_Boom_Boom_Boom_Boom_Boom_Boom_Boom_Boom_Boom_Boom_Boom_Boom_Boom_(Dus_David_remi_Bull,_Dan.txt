I'm a creeper
Minecraft's grim reaper
Blowing up blocks like Al-Qaeda
I'm not a creature
That'll eat you
But I'll leave you petrified
Peter, Remind peeps
Of Minesweeper
Clicking on a brick
Then you die in the deep
I'll find your mine
I'm a mind reader
Now the mine is mine
It's finders keepers
O Hai, I'm a Creeper
So Nice, Nice to meet you
Is that the time?
It's time to leave
And Tick, Tock, Tick, Tock

Boom Boom Boom
I can't stop singing this bloody
Tune Tune Tune
It's gonna make my brain go
Boom Boom Boom
I can't stop singing this bloody
Tune Tune Tune

I do what I wanna
Move aside, Mama
Tick Tick
I'm a suicide bomber
I take control
Then I'm gonna
Leave a gaping hole
Belladonna
That'll take its toll
When I'm on a quest to invade
Detonate your soul
Fizz like a lemonade then blow
So you'd better stay indoors
Or I'll find your mine
When you're mining ore
You'll be dying
Lying in gore
Darling, Aww
What you crying for
Did somebody break your diamond sword?
I'm the volatilest sort
What a violent force
That'll frighten Spartans
Hark and hear Leonidas talk
When he sees me
"Tonight we dine indoors!"

Boom Boom Boom
I can't stop singing this bloody
Tune Tune Tune
It's gonna make my brain go
Boom Boom Boom
I can't stop singing this bloody
Tune Tune Tune

It's official
A ballistic missile
Couldn't get this result
I blow through stone
Like a six foot chisel
So you'd better shiver
When you hear that sizzle
Fffff-o Shizzle
Take a listen
It's a premonition
Of my mission
Death by demolition
If I don't come home
There's a sign in my kitchen
To describe why I'm missing:
'Gone fission'
White hot raps
I got stacks
Sometimes when I die
I drop tracks
I got alot
Ocelot
Fight off cats
If I'm feeling nice
Then I might not... Blast

Boom Boom Boom
I can't stop singing this bloody
Tune Tune Tune
It's gonna make my brain go
Boom Boom Boom
I can't stop singing this bloody
Tune Tune Tune

My hobbies and interests include going
